Connection to the Larger Field of Computer Science

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
Computer scientists write, build, and refine software systems and intelligent algorithms that address real-world issues. What they write makes a difference because it sparks innovation in healthcare, finance, education, entertainment, and technology. Computer scientists make life easier, more accessible, and safer each day. For this project, I applied reinforcement learning to demonstrate how AI makes decisions, learns, and navigates sophisticated worlds â€” capabilities at the heart of creating wiser, more flexible technologies.

What is the computer scientist's approach to a problem?
As a computer science student, I decompose problems into their parts, learn the fundamental problem, and create a systematic solution. I prototype, test various strategies, and iterate on my solutions using data and feedback. In this project, I solved the problem by testing various training methods, neural network structures, and exploration methods until the agent learned to locate the treasure effectively.

What are my ethical obligations to the end user and the firm?
My ethical responsibility is to design fair, transparent, and secure systems. I need to ensure that the AI acts in ways not detrimental to users or promoting discrimination. Very high value needs to be placed on data usability, privacy, and security. In the case of smart agents such as the pirate, avoiding whimsicality and ensuring decisions made by the model can be explained, particularly in being deployed in actual environments, is also significant.
